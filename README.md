# Newizze-StrictSearch
Magento 2 extension that allows you to use Magento 2 fulltext search with "AND" statement instead of "OR"

As we all know, Magento 2 uses fulltext search to process user search queries. 
If you want your Magento to perform strict search with “AND” statement, this extension will help you by overriding “search_request.xml” configuration file.
